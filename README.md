# My Project
Analysis of Brain tissue scRNA-seq dataset GSE188545 containing 6 Health control and 6 Alzheimer's disease samples
1. Most of the time, batch effects exist among samples, need run integration method to eliminate it.
2. compared merged and integrated analysis workflow.
3. AD samples show clear decreased astrocytes and increase microglia.
4. cluster numbers are effected by a number of parameters when runing FindNeighbor and Findcluster, need to adjust these parameters to obtain meaning clusters.
